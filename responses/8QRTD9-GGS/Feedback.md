## 1. Count of Largest Integer

Your solution has O(n^2) worst case complexity. It would be better to keep a
memo of the largest integer and how many of them there are as you go. It would
also be helpful to name your variables something more intuitive than `N` and
`N_1` for the sake of readability. Finally, it doesn't seem to actually find
the largest integer. In fact, it totally ignores the input. Good try. Being
tested under a time limit is hard!

## 2. Sum of Certain Multiples

I'm not sure why you used `N = []` as your input again, when you should have
used the function's `x` argument. Also, the question was ambiguous (my
fault!), but what I meant was to skip numbers that were multiples of 15 (i.e. both 3 and 5).

## 3. Longest Common Prefix

No response recorded. (It's hard to code much in 30 minutes!)
