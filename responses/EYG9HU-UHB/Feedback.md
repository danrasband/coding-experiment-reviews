## 1. Count of Largest Integer

This is a very slick solution. The one problem is that the question specifies that the array can be empty. To handle this scenario, you need to check for a zero-length array before trying to get its max.

## 2. Reverse Digits

I really like this solution. The final return line is a bit terse. There's a lot packed into that one line, which can make it a bit hard to parse. If this were in software that I managed, I would request that things be given names to better document the algorithm.

## 3. Find Maximum Product

It took me a little while to figure out what `pr` stood for. Two letters isn't enough to give a good indication in most circumstances of what a function is supposed to do. Two alternatives that are better, in my opinion, are `product`, or `prod` if you're trying to be brief.

The recursive aspect of the solution is cool, but it may also add cognitive complexity that isn't really necessary.

Overall really great stuff. Most of my remarks are opinion-based, so you can take 'em or leave 'em.
