1. The `valueStore` approach works, but it's a bit inefficient in terms of
memory  usage and looping.
2. I like the use of the function to test each integer. Why not just return
`True` or `False` for that one?
3. You should use `snake_case` in Python. Rather than using generic names for
functions, it's better to give semantic that help guide your understanding.
