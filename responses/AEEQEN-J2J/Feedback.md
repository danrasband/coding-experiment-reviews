1. Excellent solution! Remember to check edge cases.
2. Nice solution. It could be improved a bit in readability, but you can't
argue with its relative efficiency for this style of solution.
3. Check out the "guard clause" style to element a bunch of indentation and the `else`. Otherwise, very good attempt.
