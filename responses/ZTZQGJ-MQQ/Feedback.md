## 1. Count of Largest Integer

Nice work on checking for edge cases from the start. You could have used
Python's `max` function to speed things up a bit, but nice custom
implementation of that. This problem has a solution that doesn't require you to
go through the list twice. Check the "golden" solution for an idea.

## 2. Reverse Digits

I really like this low-level approach that doesn't require converting the
digits to a string. However, converting the integer to a string is a great way
to clean up the code. I would also prefer more semantic variable naming. For example, `a` could have been called `is_negative` or something similar.

## 3. Find Maximum Product

Nice job with the edge case checking and splitting your solution into multiple
functions. And nice implementation of the `argmax` function!

Sorting the `B` list probably gave you some trouble. The maximum produce of
consecutive digits in the list required that the list be unsorted.

Good attempt. I'm sure you probably just ran out of time.
