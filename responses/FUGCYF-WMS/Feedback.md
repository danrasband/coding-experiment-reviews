1. Nice job checking to make sure A was non-empty. If you use a `return` in an
`if` statement, you probably don't need to wrap the `else` content in the
`else` statement. In an indentation-heavy language, it's best to be a bit
conservative of how much you indent. Also, there is a way to do this problem
without looping through the array twice.
2. Interesting way of reversing the string. Python has some nice ways to
reverse a string, so you may want to look into those. Otherwise nice approach.
3. Nice attempt!
