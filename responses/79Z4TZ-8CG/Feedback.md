## 1. Sum of Integers in a String

Using `ast.literal_eval` is cool, but probably a bit overkill (and prone to
security vulnerabilities). You can cast a string to an integer using `int()`.
The empty string scenario was also not accounted for. Overall, the approach
was solid.

## 2. Reverse Digits

It seems you like to use libraries a lot. There is no need for the deque
library here, but it works. I like how you don't mutate the `X` argument, and
your solution overall is solid.

## 3. Find Maximum Product

It looks like you were on the right track but ran out of time. Nice attempt!
