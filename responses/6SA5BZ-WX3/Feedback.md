Your solution to #1 is a bit inefficient because you sort once, then loop
through the sorted array, where you could just loop through the original array
once without ever sorting. Nice job with the second problem, but try to avoid
single-letter variables unless they are loop tracking indices or things like
that. Also, interestingly enough, there's no need to remove the minus sign
from the reversed string.
