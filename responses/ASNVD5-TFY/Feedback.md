Interesting solution to the first problem. It's a little inefficient to keep a
count of every element in the array

In python, `snake_case` is much more commonly used than `camelCase`. Your
solution to the second problem also isn't super efficient because you don't
really need to track the multiples in an array. You can just keep track of the sum along the way.

Overall pretty good stuff.
