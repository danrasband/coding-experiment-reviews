## 1. Count of Largest Integer

Nice job here. There is one case you missed, where `A` is empty. Otherwise your solution is pretty much perfect.

## 2. Reverse Digits

I like that your approach didn't involve converting the integer to a string and back. It was also smart to use a temporary variable `a` and then reference the original `X` at the end for its sign. Nice work!

## 3. Find Maximum Product

Nice work here. Some of the variable names could be longer for clarity. Otherwise, I like this approach in general.
