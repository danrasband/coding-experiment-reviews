## 1. Sum of Integers in a String

This is great. A slight improvement would be to use a list comprehension and the `sum` function (a built-in function that you overwrote with your variable):

```python
sum(int(num) for num in num_list)
```

It would also probably be a good idea to check for the empty string case
before looping.

## 2. Reverse Digits

It looks like you ran out of time. Nice work trying to struggle through this
one. See the "golden" solution for some ideas.

## 3. Find Maximum Product

Nice job trying to check for the edge cases right from the start.
