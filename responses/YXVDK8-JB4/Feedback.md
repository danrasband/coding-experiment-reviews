## 1. Count of Largest Integer

I like your thinking here. If you had used `.sort(reverse = True)`, then you
would have gotten pretty close. It's most performant to iterate through the
list just once, keeping track of the largest integer and its count along the
way.

## 2. Reverse Digits

It may have helped you to store the sign (as `-1` or `1`) before converting `X`
to a string. There's no need for the `X = X` line. Overall, great work on this.

## 3. Find Maximum Product

Sorry that you didn't understand! I'm guessing you also may have run out of
time.
