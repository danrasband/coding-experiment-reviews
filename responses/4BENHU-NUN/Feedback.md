## 1. Sum of Integers in a String

Great solution here. The only thing you're missing is the check for an empty string.

## 2. Reverse Digits

There are a couple of things that are a little funky stylistically-speaking,
but it's a good solution, technically-speaking. I would prefer more descriptive
variable names, no parens around the `ans` variable in the return call, no
`abs` on line 11 since we already know that `ans` is positive.

## 3. Longest Common Prefix

It looks like you ran out of time. Great effort!
