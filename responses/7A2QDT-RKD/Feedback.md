## 1. Sum of Integers in a String

I really like the functional approach in your solution. It doesn't handle the empty string case very well, but other than that it's really slick. Nice!

## 2. Reverse Digits

I'm not a fan of the lack of spaces between variables, operators, and scalars/
values, but nice job checking for whether the number is negative or not before
reversing. I also like that you didn't use a string method for converting the
integer to a string and reversing it's characters.

## 3. Find Maximum Product

You don't need to the `else` since you're returning in the initial `if` clause.
I like that you're using `reduce`, but your solution isn't the easiest to read,
but it does the job really well. Nice work!
