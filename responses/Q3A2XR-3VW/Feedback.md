## 1. Count of Largest Integer

This isn't the most performant way to complete the task, but it works. You
might also consider simply looping through the array once, keeping track of
the highest number and its count as you go along, using the first element to
seed the process.

## 2. Sum of Certain Multiples

I like this solution a lot. It's simple, easy to follow, and performant. Nice
work!

## 3. Longest Common Prefix

This is a solid approach. It loops through the list twice, which isn't ideal,
but it puts an upper bound on the looping over the characters in each string,
which is a very nice outcome of this solution. Nice work!
