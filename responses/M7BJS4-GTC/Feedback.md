## 1. Sum of Integers in a String

Nice solution. It doesn't work if `S` is an empty list; otherwise, it's
perfect.

## 2. Sum of Certain Multiples

Nice coding! I like that you started from 3 in the for loop, and the extra
functions make it easy to read, though they may be a bit overkill.

## 3. Longest Common Prefix

This solution is pretty darn good.
