## 1. Count of Largest Integer

Nice job on this. One thing you missed is checking for the empty array case.
Other than that, this is a really great solution.

## 2. Reverse Digits

This is an interesting take on the problem. It's a bit convoluted, honestly.
I'm not sure what `pos` stands for (`position` maybe?). There's a simpler way
to do this using built-in Python methods for sorting.

## 3. Longest Common Prefix

Why `range(100)`? I'm guessing you were simply testing things out and ran out
of time. Good try, though!
