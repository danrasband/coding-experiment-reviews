Nice work on the first problem. Make sure to account for edge cases (an empty
array input is possible in this case.).

The second problem's solution is good as well. There was some ambiguity to the
question, which I think may have confused you, but it was the right general
approach.

The third problem's solution is a bit off, but I'm guessing you just ran out
of time. Nice try!
