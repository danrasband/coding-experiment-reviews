## 1. Sum of Integers in a String

Very nice! Don't you love how simple Ruby can be?

## 2. Reverse Digits

Very slick solution.

## 3. Longest Common Prefix

This solution is a bit complicated. One thing that could have simplified your
code tremendously is to consider the first element of `a` to be the longest
prefix, and then adjust that believe as you iterate through each element.
This approach doesn't lend itself well to a functional pattern, but it works
really well. You also missed a couple edge cases.

Overall, very well done! Your Ruby code is really elegant.
