## 1. Count of Largest Integer

You have a typo (`lenght`) and `heightestNumber` should just be
`highestNumber`. I'm guessing that English is not your native language. Nice
job on checking for the empty array case, though. You could have kept track of
the count and the highest number in one pass. Otherwise the general approach
was solid.

## 2. Sum of Certain Multiples

There are several style improvements, mostly with spacing, that could be made
to this code, but the approach is solid.

## 3. Find Maximum Product

Very nice solution here. Again, I like more spaces in my code (after `if`,
around operators, etc.), but otherwise this code does the job quite nicely.

Overall excellent job!
