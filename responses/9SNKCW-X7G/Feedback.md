1. I like this approach a lot. Nice work!
2. This is a cool mathematical approach. I'll be honest and say that just
looking at the code briefly, I'm unsure if it gets to the right answer, but I
think a mathematical approach like this would be best in terms of performance.
3. This is an awesome approach. Remember to check for edge cases.
