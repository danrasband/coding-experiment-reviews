## 1. Sum of Integers in a String

Nice solution. It doesn't cover the scenario where `S` is an empty string, but
other than that it's correct. You really don't need to parentheses around the
`totalSum` variable in the return statement. Last of all, it's more idiomatic
in Python to use `snake_case` than to use `camelCase` for variable names.

## 2. Reverse Digits

This works well and is easy to follow. There could be some code style
improvements, but overall it's great.

## 3. Longest Common Prefix

Nice choice to cache the longest prefix as you go and keep track of its length.
