1. There's no need to go all the way back to -99999999999999999. You can
always just anchor off the first element of the array. Otherwise, this is a
nice solution. You may want to look into the "guard clause" style for handling
`if/else` clauses in combination with a `return` in the `if` clause.
2. This is an interesting approach. There are many other simpler ways of doing
it. Check the "golden" response in this repo for starters.
3. This solution is overly complicated. I'm sure if you had been given more
time, you'd have come up with something simpler.
