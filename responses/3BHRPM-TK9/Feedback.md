## 1. Count of Largest Integer

Nice, concise approach! Make sure to check for edge cases in input! In this case, the empty array was a possible input.

## 2. Reverse Digits

Very nice, concise approach here. I like how you used a guard clause and used
the original input to see if the result should be negative.

## 3. Longest Common Prefix

If I had known this function existed, I wouldn't have made this a question on
the test. Nice job being resourceful. You obviously know Python very well.
