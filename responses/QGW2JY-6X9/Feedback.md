1. This is a bit (read: a lot) over-engineered. There really is no reason to
use regex, nor is there a reason to check if each number is an integer, because
the instructions state exactly what the input can be.
2. This solution is also a bit over-engineered, but nice work.
3. Pretty thoughtful solution.
