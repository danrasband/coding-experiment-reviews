1. Interesting approach using regex. You may want to look at your variable
naming.
2. The problem here was a bit ambiguous, but it looks like you just tried to
avoid the ambiguous part completely.
3. Interesting approach with the `zip` function. I'm not sure how efficient
that is, but it seems to do the job.
