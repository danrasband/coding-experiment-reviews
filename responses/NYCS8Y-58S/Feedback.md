## 1. Sum of Integers in a String

Your solution definitely gets the job done in most scenarios. One thing missed
was the empty-string case. A potential improvement to the code would be to use
the Python built-in function `sum`, along with a list comprehension.

## 2. Sum of Certain Multiples

The instruction text for this problem was in fact ambiguous, which was
problematic. Sorry! It meant to not include numbers that were multiples of
both 3 and 5 (i.e. multiples of 15). In addition, it was looking for the sum
of the numbers that matched, not the count. Good attempt, though!

## 3. Find Maximum Product

Nice job checking for the edge cases at the beginning, and nice solution. It's
a bit hard to read the code because of its lack of newlines, but that's not
critical. It is very possible that the maximum is negative, so starting out
setting the highest value to zero isn't correct in some cases.

I'm pretty impressed you got to the third problem. Nice work!
