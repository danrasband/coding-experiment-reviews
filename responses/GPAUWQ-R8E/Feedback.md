## 1. Sum of Integers in a String

Nice work on this. It's concise, idiomatic Python code. One thing to note is
that you missed the case where `S` is an empty string.

## 2. Reverse Digits

Nice job checking and storing the integer's sign from the start! Knowing the constraints on input, you shouldn't need the try/except blocks. All-in-all, great stuff.

## 3. Find Maximum Product

Nice job checking for edge case scenarios from the get-go. There's no need for
the `else` since you return in the first `if` block. Lastly, this doesn't
quite get to the windowed approach that is required to get the highest product
of `X` consecutive integers from `B`. I'm sure you just ran out of time.

Nice work!
