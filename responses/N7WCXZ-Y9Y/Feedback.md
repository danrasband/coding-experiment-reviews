## 1. Sum of Integers in a String

I like the usage of `map()`. The one missing edge case check is where S is an
empty string. You also don't need to cast to `int` on line 10 since the
numbers are already `int`s. Otherwise great solution.

## 2. Sum of Certain Multiples

This solution is elegant and makes great use of the `range()` function. Nice
job.

## 3. Find Maximum Product

Your code is a bit hard to follow in this one, but I do like how you moved some of the functionality to a separate function.
