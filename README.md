# Coding Experiment Anonymous Feedback

This repo includes feedback on individuals' code responses for
our coding experiment. This experiment was performed for the
final project of W241 Experiments and Causality.

## Guidelines

We will be looking at the following aspects of the code.

1. Formatting and readability of the code evaluation (length of lines, naming of
the variables, formatting friendly to the reader's eye etc.)

2. 'scoring' by the technical reader (on a scale 0-100%) that would represent to
what extend the solution meets the expectations from their perspective

3. Thumbs up or down for the candidate base in his performance, assuming they
would be in an actual recruitment process, i.e. as a hiring manager - would you
recommend this candidate to go to the next stage of recruitment?

### Formatting and Readability Scoring Rubric

The rubric for grading the code based on formatting and readability is as
follows:

| Component   | Poor | Okay | Good | Excellent |
|-------------|------|------|------|-----------|
| Good Naming | Variable names are too short, undecipherable, or misleading. | Variable names are understandable and relevant, but maybe too short or too long. | Names are of appropriate length and make sense, but there is room for improvement. | Variable and function names are meaningful, concise but not too short, and there is no room for improvement. |
| Legibility  | Code is too terse to be legible, has whitespace inconsistencies, and is otherwise formatted in a way that is very difficult to follow. | Code is only somewhat readable, and may suffer from whitespace inconsistencies and cramped code. | Code is well-formatted, but may have issues with spacing inconsistencies or run-on lines. | Code is well-formatted so that it is easy to read and understand. |
| Conciseness | Code is overly verbose or terse and short to the extreme. | There are possibly more concise ways of solving the problem, but the code isn't too verbose. | Not much code is wasted, redundant or superfluous. | All code is of an appropriate length and gets the job done using code that is easy to read, yet brief. |

* Poor:  0-25 pts
* Okay: 26-50 pts
* Good: 51-75 pts
* Excellent: 76-100 pts

Example:

| Component          | Score     |
|--------------------|-----------|
| Good Naming        |        90 |
| Legibility         |        95 |
| Conciseness        |        50 |
| <b>Total (Avg)</b> | <b>78</b> |

### Solution Scoring Rubric

A subjective score from 0-100 on how well you think the code solves the problem
correctly and appropriately.

### Hiring Process Criteria

A subjective thumbs up or thumbs down based on your opinion as to whether or not
you think this person should be moved on to the next step in a hiring process.
For context, the job is a programming job that requires at least a
basic-to-intermediate level of competency.
